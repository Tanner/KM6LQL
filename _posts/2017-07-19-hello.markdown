Hello! My name is Tanner Smith and this is my amateur radio blog!

Or shall I say, rather appropriately, KM6LQL. I got my Technician license last Saturday. ðŸŽ‰

I intend this for this blog to just be amateur radio, anything else will be over at my [personal blog](tannersmith.me).

I've got a few more posts lined up, so stay tuned!
