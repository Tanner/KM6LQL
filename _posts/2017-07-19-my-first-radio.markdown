After I passed my Technician license exam, I began searching for a radio. For some reason, I didn't do any of this prior to getting my license. I guess I figured that I would get the license first then search for one later.

Lots of people had different suggestions for a first radio, but BaoFeng kept coming up. People had suggested the UV-5R, but that didn't appear to be in production on BaoFeng's website.

However, they did have the BaoFeng BF-F8HP, which is the third generation of the UV-5R. I'll take it! Not crazy expensive and still seemed like a good starter radio.

People online also suggested getting the Nagoya NA-771 antenna to replace the stock "rubber duck" antenna. For $17 on Amazon, that was a no-brainer.

I'll write a bit more as I use the radio more.
