title: Quick Memory Tip for the BaoFeng

When I first got the BaoFeng, and slowly read the manual to determine how to use it, I thought I had saving frequencies into memory quite easy. I had programmed in a local repeater and thought I had it made.

And then I tried the local NOAA frequency.

And it didn't work.

I spent all night trying and re-trying to get the channel to save. But it wouldn't work.

I wasn't sure if I was doing something wrong or was my radio broken?

Eventually, after lots of Google I found [this post](http://forums.radioreference.com/budget-entry-level-transceivers/307489-baofent-uv-5r-cant-save-channel-memory.html#post2609506) that detailed why the frequency wouldn't save.

It was simple.

It won't save a channel if you're currently receiving on that frequency.

Now, that's relatively easy to time if you're on a repeater and there's a break. Little harder to do when you're currently listening to NOAA that's constantly transmitting.

The easiest thing I've found to do is to remove the antenna completely and then save the frequency (powering off in-between of course).
